## Long term
- account default import configuration
- configurable / last used reconcile options
- consitency with the label,title and subtitle casing
- split merged transactions
- hx-try-include

## ultra long term
- complete docs
- mobile app
- extract the midas subflows to an npm package
- unit tests lol
- there's some things (e.g. reports) that use account name in places where it really should be account id
- button on fields in reports to open popup showing transactions included in that amount
